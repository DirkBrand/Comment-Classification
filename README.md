Main code repo for Master's project by Dirk Brand.

### Dependencies (Python) ###

* Numpy
* Scipy
* Scikit-Learn
* NLTK
* Gensim
* Matplotlib


### Instructions ###
Make a file config.py to reflect the absolute paths of the directories where the models, data sets and feature sets are stored.  Put it inside the src folder.

It should look something like this:

model_path = r'C:\deep_learning_models\\'

comment_data_path = r'C:\Repos\comments_stuff\\'


sentiment_path = r'D:\Sentiment\\'

feature_set_path = r'C:\featuresets\\'
